# no-base-class-ut-stuff
No base class mock unit-testing.

Idea:
To create a believable example of a class which has other classes as members which he owns to demonstrate "mockable" concept.

Thoughts:
* message input stream that owns message serializer.
* message output stream (dispatcher) that owns message deserializer.
